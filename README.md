# SCShareableContent hangs sample

Example project that sometimes(?) hangs when accessing SCSharableContent.current.

The await simply never returns.
Rewriting to SCShareableContent.getWithCompletionHandler {} has the same issue, the completion handler never gets called.

This only happens occasionally. After developing a ScreenCaptureKit app for a while, and thus having started and killed many screen capture sessions.

## Workaround

Restarting the ReplayKit deamon "fixes" the problem:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.apple.replayd
```

This can also be done from code:

```swift
let process = Process()
process.executableURL = URL(filePath: "/bin/launchctl")
process.arguments = ["kickstart", "-k", "gui/\(getuid())/com.apple.replayd"]

try process.run()
```

Alternatively, rebooting the computer also works.
